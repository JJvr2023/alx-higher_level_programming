In Python, there are two built-in functions for input and output:

input() takes input from the user and returns it as a string.
print() prints the given object to the console.
The input() function will wait for the user to enter something and then press Enter. The print() function will print the given object to the console, with a space between 
each object.

You can also use the f-strings syntax to format the output of the print() function.
